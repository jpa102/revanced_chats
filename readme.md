# `revanced-discussions` by [jpa102](https://github.com/jpa102)

ah yes, a repository where i can place [issues](https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions/discussions)

backstory: i originally created this when i'm not too sure to submit it to `ReVanced/revanced-patches` repository, hence the name. now it's way different than that

this can contain issues / discussions about the original revanced and revanced extended variants (i use [original](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches) and [inotia00 patches](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches) myself)

<sup>*any space can be a forum if one is ignorant enough*</sup>
